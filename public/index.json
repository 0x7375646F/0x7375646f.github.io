Lets check it out\nWoah! a login page with client side authentication lets see where it redirects to.\nHmm a interesting note.\nstop reusing credential hmm\u0026hellip; remember those client side authenticated user and pass? hm and it says change ftp port to normal Scanning All Ports # Lets start scanning the all the possible port using Nmap. we can use -p- option to check all the possible port which is 0 to 65535\nHmm~ This must be it the ftp server he mentioned in abnormal port.\nLets try to login with the creds that we got in JS file.\n:) Logged In!\nAnalaysing PCAP File # Lets download those files and see what it contains!\nSo after digging up the PCAP file one by one I found another interesting creds.\nI am using this website called apacket.com which nicely shows the http connections and other connections in a good friendly UI.\nSo lets try to use that cred in SSH!\nOk we logged in and we got our user flag. yay!!! Noice ~\nNow Lets see what we got more in this machine lets try to enumerate so we can get a privilege access. I find there is a strange file named valleyAuthentication\nLets pull that bad boy in our machine and analyse.\nScan it up !\nReversing The Binary # Hmm UPX compressed elf binary huh! lets decompress it :D\nOk now its ready to be analysed!\nFound some hash its a md5 hash (I know it cause the binary contained md5 string)\nLets decrypt it\nSo we now know username: valley password: liberty123\nPrivillege Escalation # Lets login into SSH!\nLogged in! I tried sudo -l but it didn\u0026rsquo;t have any permission so I started basic enumeration searching for cron Found it! Lets check crontab.\nInteresting file photosEncrypt hmm! Lets see what it got!\noh a b64encode encryption wow :) (actually its a encoding scheme :nerdemoji: )\nLets try to modify the python package and inject our own code shall we :)\nWe can find the base64.py package in that directory now lets modify it to get a root shell! Lets start listening for connection in port 1337 using our NCAT.\nBomb has been planted\nLets wait :D!\nWell well well now that was easy ( jk )\nTHE END!\nHEHE # ","date":"2024-12-03","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/tryhackme/valley/","section":"Writeups","summary":"","title":"Valley Writeup - TryHackMe","type":"writeups"},{"content":"","date":"2024-12-03","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/web/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Web","type":"tags"},{"content":"A stash of write-ups dissecting challenges, exploits, and machines—sorted by the platforms they were dropped on.\n","date":"2024-12-03","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/writeups/","section":"Writeups","summary":"","title":"Writeups","type":"list"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"Check out my side projects—where I push code, break stuff, and build tools to tackle real-world challenges head-on.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"list"},{"content":"Peek into my research posts, where I break down fresh vulnerabilities, unravel how they work, and drop my own discoveries.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/research/","section":"Research","summary":"","title":"Research","type":"list"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":" Security Enthusiast | Reverse Engineering Explorer | Code Breaker # Curious about everything from software glitches to hardware mysteries.
